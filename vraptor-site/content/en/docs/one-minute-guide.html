# A simple controller

We will call `Controller` classes containing the business logic of your system. Some frameworks may refer these classes as actions or services, although they do not mean exactly the same thing.

Having VRaptor dependency properly added and configured on your project, you can create your controllers for dealing with web requests and start building your system. 

A simple controller would be:

~~~
#!java
/*
* You should annotate your controller with @Controller, so all of its public methods will
* be ready to deal with web requests
*/
@Controller
public class ClientsController {

    /*
     * You may get your class dependencies injected adding the CDI @Inject annotation. 
     * It can be done directly on field or by constructor. For the second works you'll
     * need to also add a default constructor required by CDI implementations.
     */
    @Inject
    private ClientDao dao;

    /*
     * All public methods from your controller will be reachable through web.
     * For example, form method can be accessed by URI /clients/form,
     * and will render the view /WEB-INF/jsp/clients/form.jsp
     */
    public void form() {
        // code that loads data for checkboxes, selects, etc
    }

    /*
     * You can receive parameters on your method, and VRaptor will set your parameters
     * fields with request parameters. If the request have:
     * custom.name=Lucas
     * custom.address=Vergueiro Street
     * VRaptor will set the fields name and address of Client custom with values
     * "Lucas" and "Vergueiro Street", using the fields setters.
     * URI: /clients/add
     * view: /WEB-INF/jsp/clients/add.jsp
     */
    public void add(Client custom) {
        dao.save(custom);
    }

    /*
     * VRaptor will export your method return value to the view. In this case,
     * since your method return type is List<Clients>, then you can access the
     * returned value on your jsp with the variable ${clientList}
     * URI: /clients/list
     * view: /WEB-INF/jsp/clients/list.jsp
     */
    public List<Client> list() {
        return dao.listAll():
    }

    /*
     * If the return type is a simple type, the name of exported variable will be
     * the class name with the first letter in lower case. Since this method return
     * type is Client, the variable will be ${client}.
     * A request parameter would be something like id=5, and then VRaptor is able
     * to get this value, convert it to Long, and pass it as parameter to your method.
     * URI: /clients/view
     * view: /WEB-INF/jsp/clients/view.jsp
     */
    public Client view(Long id) {
        return dao.load(id);
    }
}
~~~

Note this class is independent of javax.servlet API. The code is also very simple and can be unit tested easily. VRaptor will make associations with these URIs by default:

~~~
/client/form   		invokes form()
/client/add    		invokes add(client) populating the client with request parameters
/clients/list  		invokes list() and returns ${clientList} to JSP
/clients/view?id=3  invokes view(3l) and returns ${client} to JSP
~~~


We'll see later how easy it is to change the URI `/clients/view?id=3` to the more elegant `/clients/view/3`. `ClientDao` will also be injected by VRaptor, as we'll see. You can see now the [Ten minutes guide](/en/ten-minute-guide).
